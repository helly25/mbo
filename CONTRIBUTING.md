# Intro

All contributions are generally welcome as long as they fit in with the concepts and goals of this repository and as long as the [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) is being respected.

# Code Rules

All code must adhere to the [RULES.dm](RULES.md) and mostly follows the [Google style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/). Where it diverges, clang-tidy rules are in effect as much as possible.

# Run pre-commit

All changes will be verified by the pre-commit rules. In order to check these before committing changes install the tool:

```
pre-commit install
```

Once installed the verification can be triggered for all files as follows:

```
pre-commit run -a
```

Without the `-a` only the modified and staged files will be checked.
