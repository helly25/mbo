# Run clang-tidy as an enforcing, report-only pass over the compilation scope
# affected by the given files. Source-only changes stay focused. A project
# header, generated-header template, or .bzl change promotes the scope to every
# first-party translation unit in compile_commands.json because it can affect
# sources that did not themselves change.
#
# clang-tidy resolution prefers the hermetic toolchains_llvm binary (so it matches
# the compile DB's clang flags and understands C++23), then a versioned system
# clang-tidy on PATH. A resolved clang-tidy older than the minimum below is treated
# as "not installed" and skipped - clang-tidy 16/17 mis-parse this codebase's C++23
# and emit false positives whose fixes break the build. That is not hypothetical:
# trunk pinned clang-tidy 16 and its `--export-fixes` runs rewrote the working tree
# with build-breaking "fixes", which is why clang-tidy moved here out of trunk.
# Note that a plain `clang-tidy` on PATH may well BE trunk's 16 (.trunk/tools), so
# the version gate below is what keeps it from being picked up. Mirrors the binary
# resolution ladder in tools/clang_format.sh.
