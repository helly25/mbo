# mbo/hash measurements

Dev-only tooling to run `//mbo/hash:hash_benchmark`, store the results with full
provenance, render the README performance tables, and plot ns-vs-length curves.
This is a **pure development dependency**: the whole `mbo/hash/measurements`
directory is stripped from release archives (`release_prep.sh` EXCLUDES), so it is
never part of any published/BCR offering and consumers of the library never pull
any of it in (including any heavier plotting dependencies). It is an ordinary dev
package of the `helly25_mbo` module - built and tested in dev/CI - and a
pre-commit guard forbids anything outside it from depending on it, so the release
strip can never leave a dangling reference.

This is a living design doc - update it when the layout or policy changes.

## Why this exists

The `mbo/hash/README.md` numbers are sub-nanosecond and are taken on a shared
developer machine. A single median run is dominated by run-to-run contention
noise: a change smaller than ~0.2 ns is invisible, and medians of two runs can
even invert the true ordering. So we:

- Aggregate by the **mean of the k fastest repetitions** (`k = reps/3`, so 3
  of 9). Contention only ever slows a run down, so the low tail is the
  uncontended cost; taking the _mean of the fastest few_ rejects the
  single-sample noise a pure minimum would keep, while still excluding the
  contended runs the median includes.
- Apply google/benchmark's own precautions (below).
- Store the **full run context** so a number is always attributable to a
  specific machine, load, toolchain, and source revision.

```

The C++ benchmark itself (`mbo/hash/hash_benchmark.cc`,
`//mbo/hash:hash_benchmark`) stays in the main module - it is tightly coupled to
the hash internals and is already `testonly` + `tags = ["manual"]`, so it is
dev-only but not shipped. Only the orchestration/storage/reporting lives here.

## What is captured (provenance)

Every stored dataset records, from google/benchmark's `context` plus a few
augmentations, enough to know exactly what produced it:

- **date/time** of the measurement.
- **git revision** of the measured source and whether the tree was dirty - a
  number is meaningless without the exact code it measured.
- **host name**, **CPU count**, **CPU nominal MHz**, **CPU brand/model**, cache
  sizes.
- **OS / kernel** (uname).
- **compiler** and version (the benchmark is built `-c opt`).
- **load average** at measurement time (so a noisy run is identifiable).
- **`cpu_scaling_enabled`**: if frequency scaling is on (it is, on macOS), the
  absolute numbers are unreliable; the tool records it and warns. The min
  aggregate mitigates but does not eliminate this.
- benchmark **parameters**: repetitions, min-time, warmup-time, whether random
  interleaving was on, and the aggregate used (best-`k` mean) with its `k`.

## Methodology / precautions

- Build `-c opt`.
- **9 repetitions** by default: google/benchmark's `tools/compare.py` recommends
  at least 9 for its Mann-Whitney U-test, so two stored raw datasets can be
  compared for statistical significance (`compare.py benchmarks a.json b.json`).
- **`--benchmark_enable_random_interleaving`**: interleaves the repetitions of
  every case, spreading each case across the run so thermal drift and "first
  case runs cold" bias do not accrue to whichever benchmark ran first.
- **`--benchmark_min_warmup_time`**: warm caches and CPU frequency before timing.
- Aggregate by the **best-`k` mean** (see above); we also keep `best_cv` (spread
  of those `k`) plus the full-set min / median / mean per case for transparency.
- Fixed RNG seeds in the benchmark give identical key bytes per length across
  runs (so only timing varies). Throughput is hot-cache (the same key is reused
  in the loop) by design; the latency benchmark serializes a dependency chain
  over a fixed 1024-key set - the cost profile a hash table actually pays.

## Statistics stored per case

Per (width, algorithm, length): `best` (the headline mean of the fastest `k`),
`best_cv` (coefficient of variation **of those `k` samples** - how stable the
estimate is; a full-set CV would just re-report the contention we excluded),
plus `min`, `median`, `mean` (full-set, for context) and the repetition count.
The README tables use `best`; `best_cv` flags a case whose fast tail is itself
noisy and worth re-measuring.

## Data storage, commit policy, contributions

Authoritative numbers cannot come from CI (shared, virtualized runners with CPU
scaling on - see "CI"), so measurements are contributed from real machines
(Apple M5 Pro, AMD Zen5, Intel, ...). Each run produces a fair amount of data:
the raw google/benchmark JSON gzips to ~123 KB (fast) / ~340 KB (full), the
distilled canonical JSON is ~38 KB / ~100 KB, plus the per-algorithm SMHasher3
logs. Across several machines that accumulates, so:

- **Per-machine bundle, Git LFS**
  (`data/<slug>_<cores>c_<compiler>_<gitsha8>_<stamp>.tgz`): one
  gzipped tarball per run holds the _whole_ dataset - the canonical
  `results.json`, the raw `*_raw.json.gz` (for `compare.py` U-tests), and the
  `smhasher.json` + per-algorithm logs. It is Git-LFS-tracked (`.gitattributes`),
  so the blobs stay out of the main pack; unpack to inspect or A/B. Keep the
  current bundle per machine (replace on re-measure); LFS history retains olds.
- **Published charts + tables, plain git** (`charts/<slug>_<compiler>_{64,128}.svg`
  - the hash README perf section): rendered by `hash_benchmark_report.py publish`
    from a SELECTED set of committed bundles - one labeled block per machine. Charts
    carry the machine identifier (subtitle); the tables are the curated `kReadmeSizes`
    subset extracted from the FULL dataset via the `readme_sizes` the benchmark emits
    into its own context (no separate fast run, no second size list to drift). And -
    the point - _verifiable_: `verify` re-renders from the same bundles (a manifest
    publish leaves in the README) and diffs, so every figure is provably from
    committed data and cannot be hand-edited (`_svg_plot` is deterministic). This is
    the ONLY thing that writes to the tree; the measurement run writes nothing but
    the bundle, so it stays authoritative and several runs can go back-to-back.
- The loose run outputs in `data/` are staging only and git-ignored; `bundle`
  packs them into the `.tgz`. This directory is dev-only and stripped from release
  archives, so it never enters a published/BCR offering (the release archive
  carries LFS pointer files here, which is harmless).

## Regenerate / contribute a machine

Two decoupled steps: each machine produces a data bundle (that is ALL the run
writes to the tree, so it stays authoritative and runs can go back-to-back), then
a single `publish` renders the README from the machines you choose.

**1. Measure, per machine** (repo root, clean `main` for authoritative provenance):

```sh
mbo/hash/measurements/run_measurements.py --config clang --jobs 4  # clang; omit --config for native gcc
# faster: in-house family only, or perf only
mbo/hash/measurements/run_measurements.py --algos mumbo,jumbo,dumbo --jobs 1
mbo/hash/measurements/run_measurements.py --skip-smhasher
```

ONE full perf sweep runs first and alone (SMHasher3 would contend for CPU and
skew the sub-ns numbers), then the battery (`--jobs` at once; pass/fail is
load-independent, so that only trades cores for wall-clock). SMHasher3 is built
and run in a container (`build_smhasher3.sh`, via `docker run`). The run packs a
per-machine Git-LFS bundle and prints its path - commit it:

```sh
git add mbo/hash/measurements/data/<bundle>.tgz
git lfs push origin HEAD && git push
```

**2. Publish, once** - render the README from the bundles you want to feature:

```sh
mbo/hash/measurements/hash_benchmark_report.py publish \
    --bundles data/<m1>.tgz data/<m2>.tgz data/<m3>.tgz
git add mbo/hash/README.md mbo/hash/measurements/charts
```

`publish` cuts the marker region in the hash README and re-appends one labeled
block per bundle (charts + curated tables), in the listed order; `--bundles` is
the selection. `verify` (no args, from the repo root) re-checks every featured
bundle against the committed charts, reading the machine list back from the
README's manifest.

The pipeline steps are also usable individually: `run` (perf -> canonical JSON),
`bundle` (pack a run), `tables` / `plot` (render from any canonical JSON _or_ a
bundle `.tgz` directly - given positionally or via `--results`/`--bundle`),
`publish`, `verify`. `plot --kind` selects the curves: `throughput` (the 64- and
128-bit one-shot charts, default), `latency` (the mixed-length latency curve, now
that it sweeps the full size set), or `all`. `plot --scale` selects the axes:
`log-log` (default - ns spans ~4 decades, so a linear y crushes the fast
algorithms) or `linear-log` (linear y, log x, to read absolute ns gaps in a
narrow range); x is always log since lengths are sampled geometrically.

## SMHasher3 quality (`smhasher`)

`hash_benchmark_report.py smhasher --algos all --smhasher3 <path>` runs the
SMHasher3 battery over a set of algorithms (default `all`, which **includes the
legacy `dumbo`**) and stores a pass/fail + failing-family summary as JSON with
the same provenance, plus each run's full log under `data/`.

It drives a **built SMHasher3 executable** (`--smhasher3`). `build_smhasher3.sh`
is the reproducible build: it clones SMHasher3 at the pinned commit, applies the
two documented fixes (missing `<cstdlib>` in `lib/AEStest.cpp`; replace
`-march=native`), and builds it with gcc in a container - matching the
methodology in `../README.md`. The third-party algorithms are SMHasher3
built-ins and work immediately.

The in-house `mumbo`/`jumbo` and `dumbo` are registered by `smhasher3/mbohash.cpp`,
which `#include`s the ACTUAL `mbo/hash` headers (so the real implementation is
verified, not a transcription). `build_smhasher3.sh` copies the headers + plugin
into the tree and registers the source, so one script run yields a SMHasher3
that recognizes `mumbo-64` / `jumbo-128` and `dumbo-64`. Registration names live
in `_SMHASHER_NAMES` and match `SMHasher3 --list`.

Last verified run (2026-07): **mumbo-64/jumbo-128** and **dumbo-64** all PASS
188/188 (dumbo redesigned into a compact single-lane MUM hash).

### Generated quality tables (`quality`, `consistency`)

The two SMHasher3 tables in `../README.md` (the "Algorithm overview" and the
"Results" table) are GENERATED, not hand-edited. `hash_benchmark_report.py quality
--bundle <bundle>` renders both between their `<!-- BEGIN/END ... -->` markers,
merging `hash_algorithms.json` (the manual/editorial columns) with the measured
verdict/score/failures re-parsed from the bundle's logs (the stored `smhasher.json`
predates parser fixes, so the LOGS are the truth). `quality --check` verifies the
committed tables without writing - the `quality_sh_test` bazel test / CI gate.

Two names the committed bundles have no real data for (`FNV-1a-64` /
`MurmurHash3-128`, run under invalid short names) are supplied by a hardcoded
`_MISSING_MEASURED` stopgap, warned about on every render; delete each once a
bundle carries the real measurement.

`hash_benchmark_report.py consistency` cross-checks that all bundles from the same
source git SHA report identical measurements (a SMHasher3 verdict is a property of
the algorithm, not the machine), so a divergent or broken run is caught.

## Output filenames

Loose staging files the tool writes are prefixed `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_` (local wall
clock, one stamp per invocation) so runs never overwrite each other. The
committed artifact is the per-machine bundle
`data/<slug>_<cores>c_<compiler>_<gitsha8>_<stamp>.tgz` - the slug
derived from the dataset's own `uname` + CPU brand, the `compiler` reported by the
benchmark binary (`clang-NN` / `gcc-NN`, so GCC and Clang builds on one machine
stay distinct), the SHA from its provenance - so a bundle is self-identifying and
collision-free across machines and toolchains.

## Comparison charts

Multiple measurement bundles can be compared graphically using the `diff-charts`
sub command of the `hash_benchmark_report.py` tool. Example:

```sh
./mbo/hash/measurements/hash_benchmark_report.py diff-charts --bundles mbo/hash/measurements/data/linux*.tgz --algos mumbo dumbo rapidhash
```
